underscore.js port to python
---

are you tired of using a programming language that does not have enough utility functions for the assistance of writing coder in the functional style?

perhaps you should change to python or some similar language

if you are still not satisfied perhaps you would be interested in this library


documentation coming soon

usage:
```
import underscore as _
x = _.map([1,2,3], lambda x: x * 2)
print(x)

~~~ output ~~~
[2, 4, 6]
```

please read the code for more information , it is self documenting


not currently compatible with iPython (I am in contact with them)
